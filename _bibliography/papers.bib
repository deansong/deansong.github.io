Typically, when annotating such tasks annotators are only asked to provide a single label for each sample and annotator disagreement is discarded when a final hard label is decided through majority voting. We challenge this traditional approach, acknowledging that determining the appropriate label can be difficult due to the ambiguity and lack of context in the data samples. Rather than discarding the information from such ambiguous annotations, our soft label method makes use of them for training. Our findings indicate that additional annotator information, such as confidence, secondary label and disagreement, can be used to effectively generate soft labels. Training classifiers with these soft labels then leads to improved performance and calibration on the hard label test set.",

GATE Teamware 2 is an entirely re-engineered successor to GATE Teamware, using contemporary web frameworks. The software allows the management of teams of multiple annotators, project managers and administrators - including the management of annotators - across multiple projects. Projects can be configured to control and monitor the annotation statistics and have a highly flexible JSON-configurable annotation display which can include arbitrary HTML. Optionally, documents can be uploaded with pre-existing annotations and documents are served to annotators in a random order by default to reduce bias. Crucially, annotators can be trained on applying the annotation guidelines correctly and then screened for quality assurance purposes, prior to being cleared for independent annotation. GATE Teamware 2 can be self-deployed, including in container orchestration environments, or provided as private, hosted cloud instances.GATE Teamware 2 is an open-source software and can be downloaded from \url{https://github.com/GATENLP/gate-teamware.A} demonstration video of the system has also been made available at \url{https://youtu.be/KoXkuhc4fmM}.",

abstract = {The standard paradigm for fake news detection relies on utilizing text information to model the truthfulness of news. However, the subtle nature of online fake news makes it challenging to solely rely on textual information for debunking. Recent studies that focus on multimodal fake news detection have demonstrated superior performance compared with text-only methods, thereby establishing a new paradigm for detecting fake news. However, this paradigm may require a large number of training instances or updating the entire set of pre-trained model parameters. Furthermore, existing multimodal approaches typically integrate cross-modal features without considering the potential introduction of noise from unrelated semantic representations. To address these issues, this paper proposes the Similarity-Aware Multimodal Prompt Learning (SAMPLE) framework. Incorporating prompt learning into multimodal fake news detection, we used three prompt templates with a soft verbalizer to detect fake news. Moreover, we introduced a similarity-aware fusing method, which adaptively fuses the intensity of multimodal representation so as to mitigate noise injection from uncorrelated cross-modal features. Evaluation results show that SAMPLE outperformed previous work, achieving higher F1 and accuracy scores on two multimodal benchmark datasets, demonstrating its feasibility in real-world scenarios, regardless of data-rich or few-shot settings.},
