I’m Dr. Xingyi Song (宋星仪), a Lecturer in the School of Computer Science at the University of Sheffield, UK. I am also a member of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) Group and the GATE Team (gate.ac.uk). My research interests span Natural Language Processing, Computational Social Science, Bio-medical Text Analysis, Speech Analysis, and Financial Technology. In addition to my academic role, I serve as the Chief Scientific Officer at Sentient Machines(https://sentientmachines.tech/), where I focus on applying NLP solutions to financial technology.

Previously, I worked as a Machine Translation Specialist at Iconic Translation Machine (2015–2016) and as a Research Associate on various EU-funded projects—such as Kconnect, Knowmak, and Risis2—at the University of Sheffield (2016–2021). I completed both my MSc and PhD within the NLP Group at the University of Sheffield.

I am open to research and industry collaborations, so feel free to contact me if you have any ideas or potential projects in mind.
